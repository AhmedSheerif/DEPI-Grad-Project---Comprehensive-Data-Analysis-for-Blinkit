# Blinkit Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's operational data to uncover insights across customer behavior, delivery performance, marketing effectiveness, inventory management, and sales trends. The goal is to drive data-informed decisions for optimizing business operations and growth.

## Key Objectives
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarize historical trends in sales, customer activity, and delivery performance.  
- **Prescriptive Analysis**: Provide actionable recommendations for inventory optimization, customer retention, and marketing ROI.  
- **Predictive Analysis**: Forecast future revenue and demand using machine learning (XGBoost).  
---

## Methodology
### Tools & Techniques
- **Tools**: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), Excel, Power BI, Tableau.  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, outlier detection).  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations (heatmaps, trend lines, bar charts).  
  - Feature engineering (e.g., `revenue_growth_rate`, `stock_to_revenue_ratio`).  
  - Predictive modeling using XGBoost for 30-day revenue forecasting.  

### Key Analyses
1. **Inventory Management**: Identified top damaged products and seasonal trends.  
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Highlighted high-value segments and loyalty patterns.  
3. **Marketing Performance**: Evaluated ROAS by channel and identified top campaigns.  
4. **Delivery Efficiency**: Analyzed delay causes and optimized routes.  
5. **Sales Trends**: Tracked revenue peaks and payment method impacts.
